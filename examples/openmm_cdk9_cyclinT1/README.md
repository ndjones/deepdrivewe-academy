# CDK9 / CyclinT1 — Weighted Ensemble Example

A deepdrivewe + Academy agents example for mapping the conformational landscape
of CDK9 and understanding how its activating partner CyclinT1 shifts that
landscape.  Built as a self-contained reference for both end users and for
AI-assisted development.

> **AI developers:** Read `CLAUDE.md` first — it covers the deepdrivewe
> architecture, CDK9 subclasses, design decisions, and how to continue
> AI-assisted work on this codebase.

## Scientific question

Does CyclinT1 lock CDK9's αC-helix in the active (αC-in) conformation, and if
so by how much?  Two independent weighted ensemble runs — CDK9 alone (apo) vs.
CDK9 + CyclinT1 (holo) — are compared post-hoc to answer this.

| Condition | Simulation | Expected behaviour |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| `apo` | CDK9 alone (PDB 4BCI chain A) | Free αC-helix mobility; αC-in and αC-out both sampled |
| `holo_cyclinT1` | CDK9 + CyclinT1 (chains A+B) | CyclinT1 expected to stabilise αC-in |
